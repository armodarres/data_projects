## 1. CART Overview

### 1.1 Basic Idea

**CART** (Classification and Regression Trees) is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The idea behind CART is to split the dataset into homogeneous subsets based on feature values and make predictions based on those subsets. In the case of regression, predictions are continuous values, while for classification, predictions are class labels.

The key features of CART include:
- **Binary Tree Structure**: Each node of the tree represents a decision based on one feature.
- **Greedy Algorithm**: The tree is built by choosing the best feature at each node, aiming to minimize the impurity measure.

### 1.2 CART Algorithm

The general steps of the **CART algorithm** are as follows:

1. **Start at the root node**: The dataset is initially treated as a whole.
2. **Select the best feature** to split the data based on a chosen criterion (e.g., Gini impurity for classification, variance for regression).
3. **Split the dataset** into two child nodes using the best feature and threshold.
4. **Repeat** the process recursively for each child node until:
   - A stopping condition is met (e.g., max depth, minimum samples per leaf, or impurity threshold).
   - Further splits do not improve the purity significantly.

### 1.3 Tree Construction

The CART tree is constructed in a top-down manner using **greedy splitting**. At each node:
- **For regression**, the best split minimizes the **variance** of the target variable within each child node.
- **For classification**, the best split maximizes the **homogeneity** (purity) of the classes in the child nodes, typically using metrics like **Gini impurity** or **entropy**.

---

## 2. Split Criterion

### 2.1 Regression Trees

For regression tasks, the objective is to minimize the **variance** of the target variable in each subset. This is done by choosing a feature and a threshold that results in the least increase in variance after the split. The impurity measure for a node is the **variance** of the target variable in that node:

$$
\text{Variance} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \bar{y})^2
$$

Where:
- $$ \( N \) $$ is the number of data points in the node.
- $$ \( y_i \) $$ are the target values.
- $$ \( \bar{y} \) $$ is the mean target value in the node.

### 2.2 Classification Trees

For classification tasks, the goal is to split the data in a way that minimizes the **impurity** of the target variable in the child nodes. Two common impurity measures used are:

- **Gini Impurity**: Measures the degree of **impurity** in a node. It is defined as:

$$
\text{Gini}(t) = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_k^2
$$

Where $$ \( p_k \) $$ is the proportion of class $$ \( k \) $$ in the node, and $$ \( K \) $$ is the number of classes.

- **Entropy**: Measures the **uncertainty** in the target variable. It is defined as:

$$
H(t) = - \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_k \log_2 p_k
$$

Where $$ \( p_k \) $$ is the probability of class $$ \( k \) $$ in the node.

## 3. Pruning

Tree construction can lead to overfitting if the tree becomes too deep or complex. **Pruning** is a technique to reduce the size of the tree by removing nodes that add little predictive value.

### 3.1 Pre-Pruning

Pre-pruning involves stopping the tree construction early, before it fully grows, based on certain conditions:
- Maximum depth of the tree (`max_depth`).
- Minimum number of samples in a node (`min_samples_split`).
- Minimum impurity decrease (`min_impurity_decrease`).

### 3.2 Post-Pruning

Post-pruning involves allowing the tree to grow fully and then trimming it back by removing nodes that do not improve the predictive power. The most common technique is **Cost-Complexity Pruning** (also known as **Weakest Link Pruning**), which uses a parameter $$ \(\alpha\) $$ to balance tree complexity and accuracy.

---

## 4. Random Forest Overview

### 4.1 Ensemble Method

**Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method based on combining multiple decision trees to create a robust, accurate model. The idea is to build multiple trees (often hundreds or thousands) and aggregate their predictions to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

### 4.2 Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)

Random Forest utilizes **Bootstrap Aggregating** or **Bagging**, where multiple subsets of the data are sampled with replacement to train each tree. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions (for regression) or taking a majority vote (for classification).

### 4.3 Random Feature Selection

In addition to bootstrapping the data, **Random Forest** also introduces **randomness in feature selection**. At each split in a decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered, rather than all available features. This reduces correlation between individual trees, which in turn reduces overfitting.

### 4.4 Model Aggregation

Once all trees are constructed, predictions are made by aggregating the results from each tree:
- **For classification**, a majority vote is taken from all trees.
- **For regression**, the average of the predictions is computed.

## 5. Random Forest Hyperparameters

Random Forest has several important hyperparameters that can significantly affect the model's performance. Below is a detailed overview of the most common hyperparameters, along with their purpose and impact:

### 5.1 Key Hyperparameters

1. **`n_estimators`**:  
   - **Description**: The number of decision trees to build in the forest.
   - **Impact**: More trees generally lead to better model performance by reducing variance, but at the cost of increased computational time.
   - **Typical Values**: 100–1000.

2. **`max_depth`**:  
   - **Description**: The maximum depth of each tree.
   - **Impact**: Deeper trees can capture more complexity but are more prone to overfitting. Shallower trees might underfit.
   - **Typical Values**: 10–30 or `None` (no limit).

3. **`min_samples_split`**:  
   - **Description**: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
   - **Impact**: Higher values prevent the tree from becoming too deep and overfitting, especially when there are many features.
   - **Typical Values**: 2–10.

4. **`min_samples_leaf`**:  
   - **Description**: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
   - **Impact**: This can prevent overfitting by ensuring that the tree does not fit very small segments of the data.
   - **Typical Values**: 1–10.

5. **`max

_features`**:  
   - **Description**: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
   - **Impact**: Reducing this number increases the randomness of the forest and prevents overfitting, but too few features may decrease performance.
   - **Typical Values**: `"auto"`, `"sqrt"`, `"log2"` or an integer.

6. **`bootstrap`**:  
   - **Description**: Whether to use bootstrap sampling (sampling with replacement) when building trees.
   - **Impact**: Ensures that each tree is trained on a different subset of the data, leading to more diversity between trees and less overfitting.
   - **Typical Values**: `True` or `False`.

7. **`n_jobs`**:  
   - **Description**: The number of jobs to run in parallel for the trees. Using multiple jobs speeds up the model fitting.
   - **Impact**: Allows for parallel computation, which speeds up model training.
   - **Typical Values**: `-1` (use all processors) or an integer.

8. **`random_state`**:  
   - **Description**: Controls the random number generator for reproducibility of results.
   - **Impact**: Setting the same `random_state` will ensure that the results are consistent across multiple runs.
   - **Typical Values**: Any integer value.

### 5.2 Tuning Strategies

- **Grid Search**: Perform an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.
- **Random Search**: Randomly sample hyperparameters to find the optimal settings.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Use a probabilistic model to predict the best hyperparameters based on past evaluations.

## 6. Data Preparation for Random Forest

Proper **data preparation** can significantly impact the performance of a Random Forest model. Below are some key steps in preparing your data.

### 6.1 Handling Missing Data

Random Forest handles missing data well by using surrogate splits. However, it is still good practice to:
- **Impute missing values** using mean, median, or a more sophisticated imputation method like KNN.
- **Remove rows with too many missing values** if the amount of missing data is large.

### 6.2 Feature Engineering

- **Handle Categorical Variables**: Random Forest can handle categorical data, but it may perform better if categorical variables are encoded as **dummy variables** or using **Label Encoding** for ordinal features.
- **Feature Interaction**: Random Forest can capture interactions between features, but manually creating interaction terms may further improve performance in some cases.

### 6.3 Scaling and Normalization

- Random Forest is **not sensitive to feature scaling** (i.e., no need to standardize or normalize features).
- However, it may still be beneficial to scale features if there are extreme outliers or if you're comparing it to other models like **SVM** or **Logistic Regression**.

## 7. Advantages and Disadvantages

### 7.1 CART

**Advantages:**
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Can handle both categorical and continuous data.
- Non-linear relationships can be captured naturally.

**Disadvantages:**
- Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
- Unstable: Small changes in the data can lead to large changes in the tree structure.

### 7.2 Random Forest

**Advantages:**
- **Improved accuracy**: By combining multiple trees, Random Forest significantly reduces the variance and overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
- **Robust to overfitting**: Thanks to random sampling of both data and features, Random Forest is less prone to overfitting.
- **Handles missing data**: Can handle missing values well by using surrogate splits.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Computationally expensive**: Requires a lot of memory and computation power due to the large number of trees.
- **Less interpretable**: Unlike a single decision tree, the ensemble of trees in a Random Forest is hard to interpret, reducing model transparency.
